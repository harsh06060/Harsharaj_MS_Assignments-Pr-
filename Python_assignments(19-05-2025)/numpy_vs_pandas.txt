NumPy:
What it is: A library for numerical computations, focusing on arrays (like lists but faster and more powerful).
Main Use: Math operations, especially with arrays (e.g., matrices, vectors) for calculations like averages, sums, or linear algebra.
Key Feature: Works with n-dimensional arrays (called ndarray) and is super fast for number-crunching.
Data Structure: Homogeneous (all elements are the same type, like numbers).
Example Use: Calculating the average of a list of numbers or matrix operations.

Pandas:
What it is: A library for data manipulation and analysis, built on top of NumPy, focusing on tables.
Main Use: Working with structured data (like Excel or CSV files) using DataFrames (table-like structures with rows and columns).
Key Feature: Handles labeled data (columns with names, rows with indices) and mixed data types (e.g., strings and numbers).
Data Structure: Heterogeneous (columns can have different types, like names and scores).
Example Use: Filtering rows in a table or appending data to an Excel sheet.

Key Differences
Purpose:
NumPy: Best for numerical calculations and arrays (math-focused).
Pandas: Best for data analysis and table-like data (data-focused).

Data:
NumPy: Arrays with same-type data (e.g., all numbers).
Pandas: DataFrames with mixed-type data (e.g., names and numbers).

Use Case:
NumPy: Scientific computations, like matrix math or statistics.
Pandas: Data cleaning, filtering, or working with datasets like spreadsheets.

Dependency:
NumPy: Standalone, uses low-level math libraries (like BLAS).
Pandas: Built on NumPy, so it needs NumPy to work.

Summary
Use NumPy for fast math with arrays (e.g., crunching numbers).
Use pandas for table-like data tasks (e.g., analyzing or saving to Excel).
