Libraries Used in NumPy
NumPy is a Python library for numerical computations, especially with arrays and matrices. It’s super fast and widely used for data science and math. NumPy relies on a few underlying libraries to work its magic. Here’s a very simple breakdown of the main ones:

1. BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms):
What it does: Handles basic math operations like matrix multiplication.
Why NumPy uses it: Makes array calculations super fast.
Example: NumPy’s array operations (e.g., dot product) use BLAS for speed.

2. LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package):
What it does: Provides advanced math functions like solving equations or eigenvalues.
Why NumPy uses it: For complex linear algebra tasks in NumPy.
Example: Used in functions like numpy.linalg.inv (matrix inverse).

3. Python Standard Library:
What it does: NumPy uses Python’s built-in modules like math for basic math.
Why NumPy uses it: To integrate with Python’s core functionality.
Example: NumPy builds on Python’s number handling.

4. C Libraries (like CFFI or ctypes):
What it does: Allows NumPy to run fast C code for performance.
Why NumPy uses it: Speeds up array operations by bypassing Python’s slowness.
Example: NumPy’s core is written in C for efficiency.
